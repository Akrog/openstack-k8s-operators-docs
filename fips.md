# FIPS Support for the openstack operators

## General information

FIPS 140-2 and 140-3 are designed to ensure that cryptographic tools implement
their algorithms properly. In the operator-k8s context, a given operator can be
considered FIPS compliant if the underlying components are FIPS validated.


## Build a FIPS compliant operator

To be FIPS compliant, there are a few requirements and recommendation that
should be take into account:

- Use RHEL based images with openssl to build the binary (alpine or ubuntu images
  donâ€™t have a FIPS validated openssl crypto library)
- Do not use statically linked images
- Set `CGO_ENABLED=1`
- Go containers rely on OpenSSL to detect whether the system is in FIPS mode


### Steps to build a FIPS compatible operator

In the `Dockerfile`, replace both the `GOLANG_BUILDER` and the `OPERATOR_BASE`
image to point to the `go-toolset` and the `ubi-minimal` image:

```bash
ARG GOLANG_BUILDER=registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/go-toolset:1.19
ARG OPERATOR_BASE_IMAGE=registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi-minimal:latest
```

In addition, the following parameters are required:

```bash
ARG GO_BUILD_EXTRA_ARGS="-tags strictfipsruntime"
ARG GO_BUILD_EXTRA_ENV_ARGS="CGO_ENABLED=1 GO111MODULE=on"
```

Pass the parameters defined above to the build command:

```bash
RUN if [ -f $CACHITO_ENV_FILE ] ; then source $CACHITO_ENV_FILE ; fi ; env ${GO_BUILD_EXTRA_ENV_ARGS} go build ${GO_BUILD_EXTRA_ARGS} -a -o ${DEST_ROOT}/manager main.go
```


Finally, in the `Makefile`, define build extra variables that can be passed to
the container image build process:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS ?=
..
..
..
.PHONY: docker-build
docker-build: test ## Build docker image with the manager.
	podman build -t ${IMG} . ${DOCKER_BUILD_ARGS}
```

As mentioned earlier, the proposed change is based on:

- `go-toolset`, available as a container image and allows Go to bypass the
   standard library cryptographic routines and call into a `FIPS 140-2`
   validated cryptographic library

- `ubi9/ubi-minimal`, that ships with several FIPS-validated cryptography
   libraries, including OpenSSL


## CI - Check FIPS compliance 

The [check-payload tool](https://github.com/openshift/check-payload) can be used
to verify if an operator image is FIPS compliant.
It currently runs as a [stage](https://github.com/openshift/release/pull/47453)
of the existing Prow jobs, where the operator image is built starting from the
current PR.
By default the check doesn't block merging a patch, but it's possible to let the
CI fail if the tool detect a failure when the image is scanned.
To enable the CI failure, edit the `.prow_ci.env` file present in the operator
repository and add:

```bash
export FAIL_FIPS_CHECK=true
```
